# Music and Artificial Intelligence

This code repository is the home of the [Music AI Tutorial](http://davidkantportfolio.com/music-ai-tutorial/), a collection of cloud-based, interactive tutorials that teach topics in music, artificial intelligence, and computer science. The tutorial takes a historical approach. My intention is to give cultural, technical, and aesthetic context to contemporary approaches to Music AI.

### Viewing the tutorials

The tutorials are intended to be viewed using [Google Colaboratory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11KtF1-QpE-qKRA2LWVIf2bdA_a9Afn49), a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows you to edit and run code in the browser. You can also view a static render of the tutorials via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/davidkant/mai/tree/master/tutorial/), or an interactive versions via [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/davidkant/mai/master). 

### Teaching

The ***Music AI Tutorial*** was developed for the course ***MUSC 80L: Artificial Intelligence and Music*** at UC Santa Cruz Course with instructor David Kant. I am actively seeking new opportunities to teach this course. Please contact me if you are interested!

### Thanks!
This project is in ongoing development, so please check back for updates!
